Find command makes it so easier to find the files and directories on the filesystem. We can use so many flags to find exactly what we are looking for. And it is a very powerful tool and makes life very easier.

## All files and directories
```console
local@local:~$ find /
```
This command gives every files and directories on your filesytem. You might notice few error messages saying permission denied if you are running as low privileged user.

## File Descriptors (FD)  

In Linux/Unix, everything is a file. Regular file, Directories, and even Devices are files. Every File has an associated number called File Descriptor (FD).
Your screen also has a File Descriptor. When a program is executed the output is sent to File Descriptor of the screen, and you see program output on your monitor. If the output is sent to File Descriptor of the printer, the program output would have been printed.

Error Redirection :
Whenever you execute a program/command at the terminal, 3 files are always open
*   standard input
*   standard output
*   standard error  

These files are always present whenever a program is run. As explained before a file descriptor, is associated with each of these files.

| File | File Descriptor |
| :--:| :------------: |
| Standard Input STDIN | 0 |
| Standard Output STDOUT | 1 |
| Standard Error STDERR | 2  |

So now we can direct that standard error to _/dev/null_ which is a special file in linux. This can be thought as a black hole as it discards anything that is written to it.

## Listing all files and directories with cleaner output
```console
local@local:~$ find / 2>/dev/null
```
Also find command looks recursively inside every sub folder for more files and folders.

## Listing files and directories on current directory
```console
local@local:~$ find . 2>/dev/null
```
List everything on your current directory

## Listing files only
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f 2>/dev/null
```

## Listing folders only
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type d 2>/dev/null
```

### flags for different kind of files

| Flag | File type |
| :---:| :--------: |
| b   | block (buffered) special |
| c   | character (unbuffered) special |
| d   | directory |
| p   | named pipe (FIFO) |
| f   | regular file |
| l   | symbolic link |
| s   | socket |
| D   | door (Solaris) |

## Files in multiple directories
```console
local@local:~$ find /etc /home -type f -name hello.txt 2>/dev/null
```

## Files with particular name
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -name "hello.txt" 2>/dev/null
```
Lists every file with name _hello.txt_

## Files ignoring case sensitivity
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -iname "hEllo.txt" 2>/dev/null
```

## Files with same extension
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -name "*.jpg" 2>/dev/null
```
Lists every _jpg_ file in your filesystem.

## All files owned by user root
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -user root 2>/dev/null
```

## All files owned by user root and readable
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -user root -readable 2>/dev/null
```

## All files owned by user root along with information
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -user root -ls 2>/dev/null
```
Just like executing `ls -la`.

## All files owned by group root along with information
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -group root -ls 2>/dev/null
```

## Finding all hidden file
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -name ".*" 2>/dev/null
```

## Files with specific file permissions
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -perm -777  2>/dev/null
```

## File permissions in Linux
### Numeric Mode

| Number | Permission Type | Symbol |
| :--:| :----:   | :--: |
|0	|No Permission|	--- |
|1	|Execute|	--x |
|2	|Write|	-w-|
|3	|Execute + Write|	-wx|
|4	|Read|	r--|
|5	|Read + Execute|	r-x |
|6	|Read +Write|	rw- |
|7	|Read + Write +Execute|	rwx |


777 means file which can be read, written and executed by any user on the system.


### Symbolic Mode
In the Absolute mode, you change permissions for all 3 owners. In the symbolic mode, you can modify permissions of a specific owner. It makes use of mathematical symbols to modify the file permissions.

|Operator|	Description|
| :--: | :--:|
|+	| Adds a permission to a file or directory|
|-	| Removes the permission |
|=	| Sets the permission and overrides the permissions set earlier|

The various owners are represented as -

|User |Denotations|
| :--:| :--: |
|u	|user/owner|
|g	|group|
|o	|other|
|a	|all|

The Permission Types that are used are:

*   r – Read
*   w – Write
*   x – Execute
*   s – SUID bit
*   t – sticky bit

[https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html)


## All files that are executable
```console
local@local:~$ find / -perm /a=x -ls 2>/dev/null
```
It lists files that can be executed by all users.

## All files owned by root with SUID permission
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```
And 

```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -user root -perm /u=s -ls 2>/dev/null
```

## Find all empty files
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -empty 2>/dev/null
```

## Find files using size

### Files having exact size of 1 MB
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -size 1M 2>/dev/null
```

### Files having size less than 1 MB
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -size -1M 2>/dev/null
```

### Files having size in between 1 MB and 10 MB
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -size +1M  -size -10M  2>/dev/null
```

## Find files according to modified time

### Files modified 10 days ago
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -mtime 10 2>/dev/null
```
### Files modified in between 10 and 20 days ago
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -mtime +10 -mtime -20 2>/dev/null
```

### Files modified in between dates
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -newermt 2020-01-02 -not -newermt 2020-01-20 2>/dev/null
```
All the files that were modified in between 2020-01-02 and 2020-01-20 are shown.

### Files accessed 10 days ago
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -atime 10 2>/dev/null
```
### Files accessed between 10 and 20 days ago
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -atime +10 -atime -20 2>/dev/null
```


### Files accessed in between dates
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -newerat 2020-01-02 -not -newerat 2020-01-20 2>/dev/null
```
All the files that were accessed in between 2020-01-02 and 2020-01-20 are shown.

These kinds of tricks might be helpful during incident response when you have to track back the attacker's steps on the server to find out which files were accessed or modified to keep the persistent session on the server. 

## Command execution with find

### Deleting all files with particular filename
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -iname "shell.sh" -exec rm -f {} \;
```

### Checking metadata with exiftool
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -iname "*.jpg" -exec exiftool {} \;
```
### Find something on txt file with grep
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -name '*.txt' -exec grep -i test {} \;
```
It looks for all files with extension txt and checks if it has string `test` on it using grep.

You can run other different commands using `-exec` for manipulation of file as well as contents inside it. 

## Limiting the depth for the search
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -name "*.txt" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null
```
Limiting the depth of search to only 2.

## Searching files using regular expression
```console
local@local:~$ find / -type f -regex ".*\(png\|html\)$" 2>/dev/null
```
Searching for files with png or html extension.

There are other whole bunch of things that can be done with find. You can always check for the manual of `find` using `man find`.
